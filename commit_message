Regenerate frontend API client from local OpenAPI export and add Gemini test endpoint fallback for 404 route drift
Fix schema/preview dataset-switch flow by using selected table name and auto-regenerating schema (with progress modal) on 422/empty schema
Fix misleading schema status banner: stop inferring active generation from blank descriptions and show actionable hint instead
Implement real v1 schema regeneration endpoint (LLM-backed) and wire Schema Editor Regenerate button to it
Fix v1 schema regenerate endpoint crash by adding missing asyncio import (prevents 500/CORS-like network errors)
Harden Tauri dev backend lifecycle: kill stale app.main listeners on startup and launch backend directly via venv python to prevent orphaned uv child processes
Add Tauri local session snapshot persistence (load on mount, debounced autosave, flush on unload) to restore workspace/dataset/conversation/editor UI state between restarts
Add config-driven execution provider routing (local_subprocess/local_safe_runner) with TOML/env resolution for future E2B/Piston swaps
Bootstrap and persist isolated runner venv under app data for local_safe_runner, with first-run package install + runner python env wiring to backend
Add regression tests for execution provider selection and TOML-driven executor behavior
Add configurable safe-py-runner install source strategy (PyPI/GitHub/local) with automatic fallback order PyPI -> GitHub -> local
Expose runner source knobs in inquira.toml so publication state can switch without code changes
Fix Tauri dev config resolution so execution provider is read from repo inquira.toml (enables local_safe_runner bootstrap instead of silently defaulting to local_subprocess)
Add startup diagnostics and explicit TOML parse-error logging for execution-provider config to prevent silent fallback to local_subprocess
Make runner bootstrap auto-reconcile on config changes by storing desired package/source state marker instead of one-time flag (supports adding pinned packages without manual venv deletion)
