  "release_body": "## Release Highlights\n\n- Gated tag releases on existing successful `ci.yml` results for the same commit SHA instead of re-running duplicate CI validation inside release workflow.\n- Improved release reliability by ensuring a draft prerelease is created automatically before wheel upload when missing.\n- Published wheel builds successfully to both GitHub Release assets and PyPI.\n\n## Desktop & Packaging\n\n- Kept Windows desktop release optional and non-blocking while preserving macOS desktop publication.\n- Fixed Tauri frontend prebuild command to resolve frontend path correctly across CI working-directory differences on macOS and Windows.\n- Updated desktop bundle identifier to `com.inquira.desktop` to avoid `.app` suffix conflicts.\n- Regenerated Tauri platform icon assets directly from the Inquira SVG logo for consistent branding across desktop outputs.\n\n## Dependency & Quality\n\n- Replaced Git URL dependency for `safe-py-runner` with a PyPI-compatible version constraint (`>=0.1.6`) and refreshed lock metadata.\n- Fixed package metadata quality for PyPI by adding a real description and backend package README for long-description rendering.\n- Updated Makefile aggregate test target to run both backend and frontend tests.\n- Added regression tests for release gating, release upload guards, Tauri prebuild portability, and packaging metadata validity."
