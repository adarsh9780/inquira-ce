  "release_name": "Inquira v0.5.7a2",
  "release_body": "## Release Highlights\n\n- Decoupled wheel publishing from desktop artifact builds so Python distribution can proceed even when desktop jobs fail.\n- Added wheel publishing to PyPI (trusted publisher flow via the `pypi` environment).\n- Ensured release workflow can create a draft prerelease if missing before attaching wheel artifacts.\n\n## Desktop & Packaging\n\n- Kept macOS desktop release path active while making Windows desktop build non-blocking in release workflow.\n- Updated Tauri `beforeBuildCommand` to a portable frontend build command that works in CI across runners.\n- Synced frontend build output into backend package data during wheel build so static assets are included in the wheel.\n\n## Dependency & Quality\n\n- Replaced Git URL dependency for `safe-py-runner` with a PyPI-compatible version constraint.\n- Added regression tests for release workflow publishing guards, optional Windows desktop behavior, and packaging constraints.\n- Updated Makefile test flow to include frontend tests alongside backend tests."
