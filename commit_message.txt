feat(dx): add rich-formatted make targets with wrapped output and step-level summaries

Add a dedicated pretty execution runner at scripts/maintenance/pretty_make.py to improve local developer UX with rich text panels, clear spacing, soft-wrapped output, explicit cwd/cmd context, and per-step timing
Introduce make targets check-version-pretty, ruff-test-pretty, mypy-test-pretty, test-backend-pretty, test-frontend-pretty, and test-pretty while keeping existing plain targets unchanged for CI/log-parsing compatibility
Configure pretty targets to run via uv with an explicit rich dependency (`uv run --with rich ...`) so onboarding remains frictionless without forcing a global install
Implement output safety rails in the pretty runner: long command output is wrapped for readability and truncated to the last N lines with a visible truncation marker to keep failures actionable without log flooding
Add regression coverage for this feature via tests/test_makefile_pretty_targets.py (Makefile wiring/commands) and tests/test_pretty_make_output.py (text wrapping + output truncation behavior)
Document the improved DX path in README.md and docs/commit-and-release.md so contributors can use rich-formatted local validation flows immediately

feat(makefile): clear commit_message.txt after successful git-commit target execution

Update the git-commit target to truncate commit_message.txt after `git commit -F commit_message.txt` succeeds so stale commit text is not accidentally reused on the next commit
Keep the existing check-message guard unchanged so the target still rejects empty files and duplicate latest-commit messages before attempting commit
Add regression coverage in backend/tests/test_makefile_release_workflow.py to assert the clear-after-commit command remains present in the Makefile
