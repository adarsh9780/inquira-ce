fix(safe-runner): migrate execution adapter to engine-based safe-py-runner API with compatibility fallback

Update backend safe runner integration to support the latest safe-py-runner contract where run_code requires an explicit engine object
Switch import flow to module-level API resolution and detect run_code signature at runtime to choose the correct invocation path
Use LocalEngine(venv_dir=...) for new API executions and derive venv directory from INQUIRA_RUNNER_PYTHON with strict pyvenv.cfg validation
Return a clear actionable error when INQUIRA_RUNNER_PYTHON is not a venv python path, instead of running against a system interpreter path
Preserve backward compatibility by falling back to legacy run_code(..., python_executable=...) when older safe-py-runner builds are still installed
Add regression tests for new engine path, legacy fallback path, and invalid runner python path guardrail to prevent future API-drift breakages
