chore(release): gate tag release on existing successful CI run

Replace duplicate backend/frontend validation jobs in release workflow with a CI-success prerequisite check
Add guard_release_prereqs step that verifies tag commit is on master and has a successful ci.yml run for the same SHA
Rewire build_wheel and build_tauri to depend on the shared prerequisite guard
Add regression tests to enforce CI-gating behavior and prevent release workflow from rerunning duplicate validation jobs

fix(packaging): publish real PyPI project metadata and long description

Replace placeholder backend package description with a real project summary for PyPI
Add backend/README.md and keep pyproject readme path pointing to an existing file for long description rendering
Add regression test to enforce non-placeholder description and valid readme path in backend/pyproject.toml

fix(tauri): make beforeBuildCommand resilient across runner working directories

Use npm prefix fallbacks (`.`, `frontend`, `../frontend`) so Tauri prebuild can locate frontend package.json on both macOS and Windows CI runners
Prevent frontend/frontend path resolution errors seen in release desktop jobs
Regressions: update release publish test to assert fallback command shape and portability constraints

Refresh PNG/ICO/ICNS and Windows logo variants to align desktop app identity with current Inquira branding
