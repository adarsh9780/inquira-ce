feat(release): decouple wheel and desktop publishing with pypi wheel flow

Update release workflow so wheel publishing is independent from Tauri desktop builds
Add wheel packaging prep step that builds frontend and syncs dist into backend/app/frontend/dist
Publish wheel artifact both to GitHub Release and PyPI via trusted publisher environment `pypi`
Add Makefile targets for build-frontend, sync-frontend-dist, build-wheel, and build-desktop
Fix docs freshness test to stop depending on removed docs/dummy.md
Add regression tests covering release workflow independence and new Makefile build targets
Refresh release docs to document independent wheel/desktop publishing behavior

chore(gitignore): ignore generated frontend static build outputs

Explicitly ignore src/inquira/frontend/dist and backend/app/frontend/dist to prevent tracking built static artifacts
Add regression coverage in backend/tests/test_gitignore_hygiene.py for both static build output paths
Keep local generated files intact while ensuring they do not appear in git tracking

fix(makefile): pass Cargo manifest path correctly through tauri CLI

Use `cargo tauri build -- --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` so manifest flag is forwarded to Cargo
Resolve desktop build failure caused by tauri CLI rejecting direct `--manifest-path`

fix(makefile): run desktop build from src-tauri and remove duplicate frontend build

Run `cargo tauri build` inside src-tauri to avoid invalid relative manifest path errors
Remove redundant build-frontend dependency from build-desktop because tauri beforeBuildCommand already builds frontend
Keep npm dependency installation in desktop target via `cd frontend && npm ci`

fix(tauri): make desktop prebuild frontend path robust across working directories

Update tauri beforeBuildCommand to resolve frontend directory from either repo root or src-tauri cwd
Switch make build-desktop to run `cargo tauri build` from project root and avoid relative path mismatch
Adjust regression test expectations for the updated desktop build command wiring
