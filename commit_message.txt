fix(model-catalog): make frontend model dropdown TOML-driven via backend runtime config

Add [llm].models parsing/validation to llm_runtime_config with env override support (INQUIRA_LLM_MODELS)
Expose available_models in v1 preferences response and load it into app store state
Update ModelSelector to consume injected model options instead of hardcoded list, with fallback models for resilience
Replace brittle model-selector source-string test with behavior-based checks and add backend contract/runtime tests for available_models
