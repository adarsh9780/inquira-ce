docs(site): remove script installer docs, refresh changelog, and enable Mermaid on Pages

Replace old curl/PowerShell install instructions in README/docs with pip install and GitHub Releases download guidance
Refresh docs/changelog.md to reflect current release and site/deployment changes instead of stale entries
Enable Mermaid rendering in MkDocs via superfences plus mermaid JS init script for GitHub Pages output
Add regression checks to ensure script-install docs stay removed and Mermaid config remains present

docs(ux): rewrite core documentation pages for clarity and first-time usability

Expand overview/install/development docs with clearer audience framing, workflow context, and practical guidance
Refine commit/release and CI/release pages to explain purpose, expected behavior, and operational tradeoffs in plain language
Improve downloads/index pages with clearer user paths and explicit asset-discovery explanation
Keep docs navigation chain and automation-tested markers intact while making content more descriptive and easier to follow
