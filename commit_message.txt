feat(release): enforce monotonic set-version in Makefile flow

Add root Makefile release orchestration similar to safe-py-runner for set-version/metadata/push/release/tag targets
Wire set-version to bump_versions.py with --write-version-file so VERSION is the single source of truth
Add strict check-input-version-greater guard so make set-version fails when version is same as or lower than current VERSION
Keep metadata generation wired to generate_release_metadata.py to refresh .github/release/metadata.json from release_metadata.md
Add regression tests for Makefile wiring, VERSION read behavior, and the new monotonic version guard

docs(release): document atomic commit flow and optional release steps

Update README with a single commit and release section using Makefile targets
Mark release flow as optional and emphasize atomic commands (make test/git-add/git-commit/git-push)
Explicitly discourage make push for routine usage unless user is absolutely sure
Document set-version and metadata steps in release path, including strict greater-than VERSION rule
Add regression test that enforces README guidance for atomic commit preference and optional release flow

docs(structure): split docs into topic files and make README a TOC

Convert root README into a documentation index linking topic-based files under docs/
Move root CONTRIBUTING.md, GEMINI.md, and dummy.md into docs/
Add focused docs pages for overview, install, development, commit/release, CI automation, architecture, roadmap, and changelog
Add next-link navigation between the main docs pages so readers can follow a linear path
Update README/docs regression test to assert TOC links and next-link chain

docs(readme): add production-style landing content with logo and badges

Upgrade root README to include logo, badge strip, project tags, quick start, and common command flows
Keep README useful for end users while preserving docs split via explicit documentation map links
Retain links to all topic-based docs and deep-dive references under docs/
Update README regression test to validate logo/badges and core sections

docs(readme): add production-style landing page with logo, badges, and tags

Restore root README as a user-facing project entrypoint with logo, badge strip, and quick-start commands
Add visible project tags and a latest-release badge for production-grade discoverability
Keep docs split model by linking to all topic pages under docs/
Update README regression test to validate the new README structure

docs(cleanup): remove obsolete pyodide documentation references

Remove Pyodide architecture doc from docs/ because the project no longer uses Pyodide
Drop README and architecture-page links that pointed to the removed Pyodide doc
Keep remaining architecture and workflow documentation intact

docs(audit): refresh docs for current make-based workflows and safety

Update docs to match current release flow (set-version/metadata/test/git-add/git-commit/git-push/git-tag)
Replace stale direct-script examples in contributing and release process docs with Makefile-first commands
Remove stale fixed version mention from overview and align changelog wording with current README style
Sanitize docs/dummy.md by removing token-like content and replacing with a safe placeholder note
Add docs freshness regression tests to prevent stale flow references and accidental secret placeholders

chore(hygiene): stop tracking cache junk and strengthen gitignore

Expand .gitignore to cover common cache/build artifacts (.pytest_cache, .mypy_cache, .ruff_cache, coverage, .DS_Store, backend/.venv, frontend/dist)
Untrack already-committed .DS_Store files from root, backend, and frontend paths
Add regression test to enforce core .gitignore hygiene patterns

feat(makefile): add check-version to print all effective project versions

Add scripts/maintenance/show_versions.py to report versions across VERSION, backend, tauri, frontend, installer URLs, and release metadata
Wire new make check-version target to that script and expose it in Makefile help
Update README and commit/release docs to include make check-version in atomic workflow
Add regression tests for Makefile target wiring, show_versions output keys, and README mention

chore(makefile): use commit_message.txt for git-commit and validation

Switch make check-message to read and validate commit_message.txt instead of commit_message
Switch make git-commit to run git commit -F commit_message.txt
Update docs and regression tests to enforce commit_message.txt as the single commit message source
