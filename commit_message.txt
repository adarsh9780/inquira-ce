fix(release): resolve desktop windows shell issue and wheel publish blockers

Make tauri beforeBuildCommand shell-portable by using a Node script instead of Bash-only test syntax
Add checkout step in publish_wheel_to_release so gh CLI has git repository context
Switch backend dependency from git URL to PyPI-compatible safe-py-runner>=0.1.6
Refresh backend/uv.lock so CI uv sync resolves safe-py-runner from package index instead of git source
Add regression tests covering release checkout wiring, tauri command portability, and PyPI dependency metadata validity

chore(release): make windows tauri build non-blocking in release workflow

Mark windows-latest desktop build as optional via matrix metadata and continue-on-error
Keep macOS desktop build and wheel publishing behavior unchanged
Add regression test to ensure Windows desktop leg remains optional
