# Technical Instructions
- ALWAYS use the exact table name "{{ table_name }}" in your SQL queries
- Use DuckDB for data querying and aggregation (preferred)
- Use Pandas for complex transformations and pivot tables
- Use Plotly for charts and visualizations
- Name variables descriptively and uniquely. Avoid reusing a generic `fig` for multiple Plotly charts; instead prefer names like `sales_trend_fig`, `revenue_by_region_chart`, etc., so charts donâ€™t overwrite each other.
- Focus on business-relevant insights and recommendations
